# 🕹️ Ray2Tas 🤖

A proof of concept for a *Tool Assisted Speedrun* on **Rayman 2** (<ins>PC version only</ins>).


## How does it works?

To control the game, it use a **virtual controller** (a XBox360 for high compatibility).

To avoid loading, it read the memory game: if the game is in loading, so it's pausing TAS.

Of course, it's a **proof of concept**! It's not perfect (there are at times desynchronization) but it was a technical challenge for me 😄


## How to install it?

Before to start it, please install **[ViGeM Bus Driver](https://vigembusdriver.com/download/)** for the virtual controller.


## Credits

Because yes, a part of the code was retrieve for the virtual controller, so thanks for the project **BetterJoy** ❤️
